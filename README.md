# ML-DL_CIFAKE_FinalAssignment

**Course**:	Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This Github Repository contains the code for our final project called: **From Optimization to Defence: Evaluating CNN Robustness Against FGSM Attacks on AI-Generated Images**

The code contains the data loading (via kaggle API), preprocessing steps, and implementation of all machine learning algorithms used in the study. 
Explanations are provided, with a particular focus on CNNs and defense mechanisms.

_Please note: Loading the entire code requires significant computational power and RAM. It is recommend to use additional GPU for running._
